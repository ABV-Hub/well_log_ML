#Unconformity or Onlap?
This notebook builds synthetic data to classify well logs based on stratal geometry.
 Specifically it is focused on classifying a well as either having an angular unconformity or onlapping a structural high. 
 There is plenty of work that can be done going forward to build out the training data with more real world examples.
